XINS requires the following software to be installed:
 - Java: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html
 - Ant: http://ant.apache.org

Once installed you should set the following environment variables:
 - JAVA_HOME to the directory where Java has been installed.
 - ANT_HOME to the directory where Ant has been installed.

Note that because Ant or Java is not installed,
the "Compile and run demo" feature at the end of the installation will not work.
