CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 2.2 ALPHA 1:

* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Applied patch #1820583: Try to use the context ClassLoader to load a
    class using Class.forName().

    Class.getContextClassLoader() is Java SE 5 dependent.
  - Implemented RFE #1809379: ElementParser.parse(File).
  - Implemented RFE #1812214: Element.getUniqueChildElement().

    sent and there is no default.
    This change may break the compatibility of your code if you had optional
    input parameters or attributes returning primitive types (int, short,

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.4.0 ALPHA 1:


NOTE: This release is based on XINS 1.3.0-rc2.

* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Fixed so-called 'dead local stores', reported by FindBugs, in classes
    HTTPServiceCaller and ElementParser.
  - Marked the following non-public inner classes as static:
    ChainedMap$ChainedSet, ChainedMap$EntrySet and ElementParser$Handler.
  - Removed unused field _withCentury from class DateConverter.
  - Implemented RFE #1359749: Added support for Unicode in URLEncoding.
    . The NonASCIIException is no longer thrown by encode() and decode() and
      is marked as depreceated.
    . Marked the WhislEncoding as deprecated. URLEnconding should be used
      instead.
  - Modified PropertyReaderUtils to use the URLEncoding instead of the
    WhislEncoding.
  - Fixed a minor bug in the InitializationException class, method
    createMessage. If the message for the cause exception is null, then an
    IllegalArgumentException would be triggered in FastStringBuffer, method
    append(String).
  - Fixed the Javadoc documentation for the logIgnoredException methods in
    class Utils.
  - Implemented RFE#1359786: Added getUniqueChildElement() method to
    org.xins.common.xml.Element.

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Fixed two issues in the AccessRuleFile class:
    - The interval was never stored, was lost during re-initialization and the
      file was consequently never re-read again.
    - The object was never internally marked as disposed.
  - Implemented SF.net RFE #1359962: Automatic CallingConvention detection:
    . Added log messages 3508-3511.
    . Implemented an algorithm in CallingConventionManager to detect the most
      appropriate matching calling convention for a request that does not
      specify any.
    . Added a parseXMLRequest method to class CallingConvention that only
      accepts an HttpServletRequest (and not also a boolean that indicates
      whether the content type should be checked). The content type will
      always be cheched. This method is added for convenience and to avoid
      confusion by potential CustomCallingConvention implementors. The

      CustomCallingConvention class documentation has been updated.
    . Added the package-private method 'matchesRequest(HttpServletRequest)'
      and a delegate for it, the protected method
      'matches(HttpServletRequest)' to class CallingConvention. These methods
      are used to determine whether the calling convention is expected to be
      able to handle the specified request successfully.
    . Changed some constants in the XSLTCallingConvention from private to
      package-private.
  - Added caching to the parseXMLRequest methods in class CallingConvention.
    Added DEBUG-level log messages 3512-3515 so it can be traced how this
    cache behaves.
  - Made the constructors of classes SOAPCallingConvention and
    XMLRPCCallingConvention throw an IllegalArgumentException if the API
    argument is null.
  - Marked XSLTCallingConvention$URIResolver as a static inner class.
  - Applied some minor refactorings to several classes.
  - Modified FormattedParameters to use the URLEncoding instead of the
    WhislEncoding.

* Logdoc:
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1351055: Incorrect code generated for exception message.
  - Minor refactoring in class LogCentral.
  - Changed the private AbstractLog$CustomLevel class to final.
  - Implemented the toString() method on the AbstractLog$Controller class.
  - Printing error message to System.err if a locale is not supported by one
    of the Logdoc-generated Log classes
  - Fixed Bug #1374150: Multiple Logdoc with multiple implementations
    does not work.
  - Implemented RFE #1359758: Log the request with URL.
  - Implemented RFE #1359772: Added the possibility to write the stack trace
    at the same logging level as the message.

* Calling convention requirements definitions:
  - Added a format description of the XINS standard calling convention in a
    new src/xml/cc-spec/xins-std/cc-spec.xml file.

* Generatation of specdocs:
  - Moved header.xslt and footer.xslt from src/xslt to src/xslt/specdocs.
  - Started work on SF.net RFE #1345859 ("Document specification/example
    interpretation rules"): Added 'Help' page, with link in header. The page
    contains a list of the requirements for the XINS standard calling
    convention (from the cc-spec.xml file).
  - Changed the CSS so that thin borders are now 1px instead of 1pt. That
    fixes a minor visual glitch.
  - Implemented RFE #1189392: Generate Logdoc HTML for API.

* Generation of server-side Java code:
  - Implemented RFE #1359780: The modifier of the get methods of the generated
    RuntimeProperties has changed from package only to public.
  - Added support for hyphens and dots in the parameter names, attribute names
    and element names.
  - Adapted the code generated for checking the parameters in order to avoid
    variable name conflict when the same element is used inside other
    element at different XML levels.

* Generation of client-side Java code:

  - Improved the generation of the CAPI [Function]Request classes:
    . Fixed SF.net bug #1362875: Overriding Request input value with empty
      string ignored.
    . Implemented SF.net RFE #1359740: Add get methods for CAPI Request
      objects.
    . Implemented SF.net RFE #1362836: [Type].toString is called twice in CAPI
      Request set methods.
  - Added support for hyphens and dots in the parameter names, attribute names
    and element names.
  - Adapted the code generated for checking the parameters in order to avoid
    variable name conflict when the same element is used inside other
    element at different XML levels.

* Generated JUnit test:
  - Implemented RFE #1359778: Added if the build properties test.start.server
    is set to true the test target will also start the API Servlet.

* Generated test forms:
  - Implemented RFE #1359804: A textarea is used to enter the data section
    value.

* Generation of Open Document Format:
  - Started the implementation of RFE #1189420: Generate specdocs in
    OpenDocument format. New xins command 'opendoc' added.

* Generation of the WAR file:
  - Implemented RFE #1182932: Set bootstrap properties in impl.xml.
  - Implemented RFE #1359742: Add html/js files to the generated WAR file.

* XSLT:

    file location.
  - Parameters not used are not passed to the templates anymore.
  - Removed unused included templates in some templates.

* DTD:
  - Copied all 1.3 DTDs to 1.4 DTDs.
  - Introduced the 1.4 DTDs, where appropriate.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.3.0 RELEASE CANDIDATE 1:

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1263832: No unique call ID for meta-functions.
  - Refactored CallingConventionManager. Fixed SF.net bug #1336471 (Failed
    creation of a calling convention fails the server) in the process.
  - No longer logging the associated exception when logging message 3301. This
    message is logged when the runtime properties file exists at start-up, but
    cannot be opened.
  - Removed unused log messages 3201, 3204 and 3611.
  - If the calling convention throws an IOException when converting the
    result, the exception is logged and a '500 Internal Server Error' is
    returned.
  - Fixed a bug in all CallingConvention instances. The
    HttpServletResponse.setEncoding(String) method was called _after_ calling
    getWriter(), which is invalid according to the Java Servlet 2.4
    Specification.
  - Moved log messages 3237-3241 three IDs up (to 3240-3244). These log
    messages are new since XINS 1.3.0. Added log messages 3237-3239 in
    between:
    . 3237: Creating calling convention
    . 3238: Created calling convention
    . 3239: Error while creating calling convention
  - Replaced log message 3560 with 3239.
  - Added log messages:
    . 3245: Determined default calling convention
    . 3246: No custom calling convention specified

    . 3247: Custom calling convention is specified
    . 3507: Unable to retrieve calling convention
  - Implemented SF.net RFE #1263809 ("Refactor: init(ServletConfig) should not
    throw ServletExc.") The servlet initialization now always fails silently,
    meaning that the servlet container is not notified by means of an
    exception.  This is done to avoid re-initialization by the servlet
    container.
  - Removed log messages 3000, 3001 and 3002, about the initialization of the
    servlet. These log messages are considered irrelevant and possibly even
    confusing. See SF.net bug report #1263768: "Log: Servlet init succeeded
    while framework init failed."
  - Changed level of log message 3231 from INFO to DEBUG.
  - Added support for an optional 'detail' parameter to the following log
    messages: 3209, 3215, 3222, 3242, 3411, 3418, 3423 and 3437.
  - Quoting reason parameter in translations for message 3210.

CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.3.0 BETA 4:

* Logdoc:
  - Added public static method useDefaultLocale() to LogCentral.
  - Fixed the encoding of all Logdoc XML files (under src/logdoc) from UTF-8
    to ISO-8859-1.
  - Improved performance and memory footprint to generate the translation
    bundle files.

* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Rewrote the MandatoryArgumentChecker class in org.xins.common. If the
    passed argument name is null, then a programming error is logged and a
    ProgrammingException is thrown. Improved the unit tests.
  - Changed the interface of the DateConverter class. Replaced the class
    function toDateString(long,boolean) with an instance method format(long).
  - Improved logging in HostnameTask.
  - Removed unused method 'log' from class org.xins.common.Utils.
  - Improved the message for a ProgrammingException.
  - Improved the implementation of the HTTPCallConfig class. Implemented the
    describe() method and made the HTTP method required in setMethod. This
    solves an inconsistency in the Javadoc comments.
  - Changed the copy method of the ExpiryFolder so it can be executed even if
    the strategy is stopped.
  - Changed the HTTPCallResult constructor to check all mandatory arguments at
    once.
  - Improved the message for an InitializationException, added a unit test,
    and fixed a bug (a NullPointerException) in the creating of the message.
  - Logging unsupported protocol as message 1308 (in the DescriptorBuilder).
  - Added getters for detecting class/method, subject class/method and detail
    in class ProgrammingException.
  - Added getCallingClass(int) and getClassMethod(int) methods in class Utils.
  - Slightly changed Utils.logProgrammingError(String). The caller is assumed
    to be the detecting class/method, while the caller of the caller is now
    expected to be the subject class/method.
  - Added missing toHexString(FastStringBuffer,char) method in class
    HexConverter. Unit tests for this new method are in place.
  - Added TextUtils.trim(String,String) that returns the trimmed version of
    the first argument, or the second argument if the first argument is either
    null or empty (after trimming).
  - Changed Utils.logIgnoredException to have the same order of arguments as
    the corresponding logProgrammingError method.
  - Added a version of Utils.logIgnoredException that accepts a detail
    message.
  - Made the HTTPServiceCaller class compatible with HTTPClient 2.0.2.
  - Implemented the getScheme(), getRequestURI() and getRequestURL() method
    in the internal Servlet container.

  - Added method isUsable() in class Manageable.
  - Removed the unused log messages 1000-1005.
  - Improved Javadoc comments and formatting.

* XINS/Java Client Framework:
  - Improved the implementation of the XINSCallConfig class. Implemented the
    describe() method and made the HTTP method required in setHTTPMethod. This
    solves an inconsistency in the Javadoc comments.
  - Changed the XINSCallResult constructor to check all mandatory arguments at
    once.
  - Printing max 1024 bytes of the received HTTP data in the exception message
    in case of an invalid XINS call result (i.e. parse error).
  - Improved Javadoc comments and formatting.
  - Unit tests added for unicode charcters in prameters.

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1323689: AccessRuleFile not printed correctly in log
    message 3429.
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1328702 ("Removing log locale setting does not reset

    locale"): When a log locale is first specified in the runtime
    configuration and then later on remove from the runtime configuration, the
    framework now switches back to the default locale. This problem was
    probably in XINS since release 1.0.0.
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1326533: Incorrect MIME type support.
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1263829. If a meta-function now throws an exception,
    then transaction logging will still be performed.
  - Fixed bug: Now actually allowing the reload interval to be 0 in the
    AccessRuleFile.
  - Fixed bug: Now correctly reporting a negative reload interval instead of
    logging an IllegalArgumentException (in class API).
  - Stored the name of the parsed ACL file in case of re-initialization. This
    fixes a bug in the AccessRuleFile that caused an issue at
    re-initialization.
  - Improved performance of log messages 3540 and 3541 by making FormattedDate
    use the performance-optimized method in DateConverter.
  - Only logging unused properties (message 3434) if the framework
    (re-)initialized successfully.

    especially when the file is not found. Also now correctly setting the
    cause of the ParseException to the related IOException.
  - Improved the translations for log message 3522. Previously the message was
    vague and misleading.
  - Fixed minor typos in the description of log messages 3540 and 3541.
  - Removed log messages 3430 and 3601. Instead of any of these, message 1050
    (programming error detected) is logged.
  - Removed log message 3236 (API build version is not set). Instead, message
    3232 (Expected bootstrap property to be set) is logged.
  - Consequently using the term 'API-manageable' instead of 'Manageable
    object' in log messages.
  - Applied more improvements to various log messages.
  - Improved state checking in CallingConvention class.
  - Improved XSLTCallingConvention. Now throwing an
    InvalidPropertyValueException if the cache setting is neither "false" nor
    "true". If the property is not set, then by default the cache is enabled.
    Logging whether the cache is enabled using messages 3440 (enabled) and
    3441 (disabled).
  - Added more comments in the XSLTCallingConvention.
  - Fixed if a calling convention fails at the initialization, it can
    be re-initialized.
  - Made the _CheckLinks meta function also compatible with HTTPClient 2.0.2.
  - Simplified reading of the XML request in class CallingConvention. This
    should speed-up the handling of incoming XML documents and it should
    reduce object churn.
  - Fixed bug: Now correctly reporting an invalid reload interval instead of
    logging an NumberFormatException (in class API).
  - Rewrote the CallingConventionManager. Added a significant amount of
    logging for CallingConventions.

CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.3.0 ALPHA 1:

NOTE: This release is based on XINS 1.2.0.

* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Made tests for type classes Date and Timestamp compatible with Java 1.3.
    Previously they used Java 1.4-specific functionality.
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1201270, so that the 'run' target now works, even if the
    computer is not connected to the Internet.
  - Removed trace logs from the code.
  - Fixed bug #1211277: XINS does not work with proxies.

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Changed the MetaFunctionsTests to properly detect the Java version and
    omit certain checks on Java versions prior to 1.4.
  - Removed the trace methods in the APIServlet class.
  - Refactored the APIServlet class. The APIServlet is now only a small
    servlet class, that delegates completely to the newly-introduced Engine
    class. The inner class APIServlet.State has been replaced by the
    EngineState class. This is in the scope of RFE #1203640, which pertains to
    simplification of the APIServlet class.
  - Fixed bug #1208936: Erroneous non-assignments in XSLTCallingConvention
    class.

    thrown.
    Added a unit test case to check this.
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1060861: IllegalArgumentException if output param is
    required but null. Now if an output parameter is required but not set,

    Bug #1182928 was a duplicate of this one.

* Logdoc:
  - Fixed Logdoc DTDs were not loaded locally if the XINS directory contains
    spaces.

CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.2.0 ALPHA 2:

* General:
  - Executed all unit tests on the Blackdown 1.4.1_01 JVM for Linux/x86. The


    tests did NOT succeed. In fact, at least 2 problems were found:
    . SF.net bug #1113862: IPAddressUtils.getLocalHost gets NPE on Blackdown
      JVM 1.4.1. This problem was worked around since this was very easy to
      implement.
    . SF.net bug #1113881: 'ant -lib lib tests' hangs on Blackdown JVM 1.4.1
    Then the tests were rerun using the Blackdown 1.4.2_01 for Linux/x86. On
    this JVM the tests did succeed. No more time is spent on supporting the
    Blackdown 1.4.1 JVM and this JVM is considered incompatible with XINS.
  - Successfully ran all unit tests on the Sun 1.4.2_07 JVM for Linux/x86.

* Logdoc:
  - Fixed bug 1109942: Added missing translation for log messages 1404-1407.

* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1113843: Utils.getJavaVersion() does not work with
    Blackdown JVM. It now properly recognizes the major Java version on

    Blackdown JVMs. Tested this successfully on both 1.4.1_01 and 1.4.2_01.
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1113862: IPAddressUtils.getLocalHost gets NPE on
    Blackdown JVM 1.4.1. This problem was not really fixed, since the source
    of the problem is in the Blackdown JVM self. It was worked around though.
  - Implemented SF.net RE #1124698: Added isProtocolSupported(String) method
    to class ServiceCaller.
  - Changed the internal names of the standard types to start with an
    underscore. E.g. "int32" is now "_int32".

  - Changed HTTPServiceCaller to work with HttpClient 3.0 only. HttpClient 2.0
    is now no longer supported.
  - Added 'copyFrom' method to class ProtectedPropertyReader.
  - Introduced IncorrectSecretKeyException class to be used by the
    ProtectedPropertyReader and the ProtectedList classes so clients can
    distinguish between secret key mismatches and other illegal argument
    exceptions. The class is derived from class IllegalArgumentException to
    retain backwards compatibility.
  - Added tests for class ProtectedPropertyReader.
  - Added crop(int) to class FastStringBuffer.
  - Added class function list(String,Object[],int) to class CollectionUtils,
    with unit tests.
  - Added 2 additional constructors to class ProtectedList and improved the
    Javadoc API documentation.
  - Added getter for additional detailed information (called 'getDetail()') in
    class TypeValueException.
  - Added package org.xins.common.specs which provides an abstraction of a
    XINS API specification.
  - Added getClassName(Object) and getNameOfClass(Class) functions to class
    Utils.
  - Fixed the method fromString() of the _base64 standard type.
  - Fixed the method toString(Object) of the _base64 standard type.

    data type it returns the fully-qualified name of the corresponding wrapper
    class. E.g. for 'int' it returns 'java.lang.Integer'.
  - Added two method in hungarian.xslt to translate a property name to
    a well written Java variable name.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.2.0 ALPHA 1:

NOTE: This release is based on XINS 1.1.0-rc1.

* General:
  - Changed all Java code and the tests so that the XINS code now executes on
    Java 1.3 as well (SF.net RFE #1108205). All unit tests were tested
    successfully on the following Java VMs:
    . Sun Java 1.3.1_15 (Linux 2.6/x86)
    . Sun Java 1.4.2_06 (Linux 2.6/x86)
    . Sun Java 1.4.2_06 (Windows 2000/x86)
    . Sun Java 1.5.0_01 (Linux 2.6/x86)
    . Sun Java 1.6.0 Early Access, Jan 20 2005 (Linux 2.6/x86)
  - Changed the xins shell script and the xins.bat batch file to pass the -lib

    option to Ant to pass the XINS lib directory. This is required when using
    Java 1.3. Otherwise it may not be able to find the proper XML/XSLT
    libraries.
  - Linking to Java 1.3 API docs instead of the Java 1.4 API docs.

* Logdoc:
  - Deprecated the LogdocExceptionUtils class in favor of a new ExceptionUtils
    class.

* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1105761: ExpiryFolder constructor log message incorrect.
  - The Base64 class has been deprecated and may be removed in coming
    releases.
  - Improved the accuracy and stability of the ExpiryFolder and ExpiryStrategy
    classes. The tests have been extended a lot. They now also test the

    addListener and removeListener methods and the listener callback. Improved
    the logging in the ExpiryStrategy; added log messages 1404-1407.
  - Changed ExceptionUtils class to be compatible with Java 1.3 (part of
    SF.net RFE #1108205). Used the unit tests to confirm it still works
    correctly under Java 1.4.  Although it indeed compiles with Java 1.3 now,

    the unit tests cannot be run with Java 1.3 yet.
  - Replaced all reference to the Base64 class of the XINS Common library to
    the Base64 class of the Apache Common Codec library.
  - Deprecated the org.xins.common.ExceptionUtils class in favor of the
    org.xins.logdoc.ExceptionUtils class.
    correctly under Java 1.4.
  - Added a Java version retrieval function to the Utils class.
  - Implemented SF.net RFE #1107376: Added a unit test for socket time-outs in
    the HTTPServiceCaller class.
  - Added clear(Object) method to the ProtectedPropertyReader class.
  - Added 'protected final void setCallConfig(CallConfig)' to the
    ServiceCaller class. This allows the fallback call configuration on a
    service caller to be set after construction.
  - Added 'public final void setHTTPCallConfig(HTTPCallConfig)' and
    'public final HTTPCallConfig getHTTPCallConfig()' methods to the
    HTTPServiceCaller class.

* XINS/Java Client Framework:
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1109810: Incorrect parsing of the returned XML.
  - Changed access level of the setUnsuccessfulXINSCallExceptionFactory and
    getUnsuccessfulXINSCallExceptionFactory methods in class XINSCallRequest
    from public to package-private.

  - Added methods to the AbstractCAPI class:
    . public final XINSCallConfig configuration()
    . public final void configure(XINSCallConfig)
  - Added 'public final void setXINSCallConfig(XINSCallConfig)' and
    'public final XINSCallConfig getXINSCallConfig()' methods to the
    XINSServiceCaller class.

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Added support for custom calling conventions.


* Generated build file:
  - Removed the dependencies from the classpath when compiling the types.

* Build and release process:
  - Added -init-release in the dependencies to facilitate the making of a
    release if a target fails.
  - The build/testresults/log4j.log file is now created when executing the
    test-ui target.
  - Fixed the script to upload the Javadoc when creating a release.
    This bug has been in XINS since XINS 1.1.0-alpha8.
  - Set the target VM as 1.3 instead of 1.4 as part of the implementation of

    Java 1.3 support (SF.net RFE #1108205).
  - Set the tar task to handle long file names as GNU tar.
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1109858: The source code is no longer copied to the
    build directory for the javadoc or the j2h command. Only the package
    target will copy the files to a new build/lf directory to unify the
    newline characters.
  - The clean target does not delete the file that are not regenerated in
    the release anymore.

* Tests:
  - Improved performance of tests. Starting server before any of the tests.
    After all tests are run, the server is stopped.
  - Showing standard output and standard error in the generated HTML page.
  - Now logging the output to the console (so it is displayed in the HTML
    page) instead of to a file.

* Libraries:
  - Updated Apache Jakarta Commons HttpClient from 2.0.2 to 3.0-beta1.
  - Updated Apache Jakarta Commons Net from 1.1.0 to 1.3.0.
  - Added Apache Jakarta Commons Codec 1.3 (because it is a dependency for
    HttpClient 3.0-beta1).
  - Added xml-apis.jar and xercesImpl.jar from Xerces 2.6.2 (for use with Java
    1.3)
  - Added Xalan 2.6.0 (for use with Java 1.3).

* Generation of CAPI classes:
  - Added proper @since tag (for XINS 1.1.0) on the generated create methods.
  - Implemented RFE #1080066 (allow HTTP method to be specified for CAPI call)
    and RFE #1080065 (allow unconditional fail-over to be specified for CAPI
    call) and started implementation of RFE #1110484 (make CAPI call with
    request object):
    . Renamed function_to_java.xslt to function_to_result_java.xslt.
    . Added function_to_request_java.xslt which produces a <Function>Request
      object.
    . Generating one call(<Function>Request) method per function in the
      generated CAPI class.
    . Generating one call(<Function>Request,XINSCallConfig) method per
      function in the generated CAPI class.
  - Implemented RFE #1110691: Deprecate create methods in CAPI class. These
    have been replaced by equivalent constructors.

* Generated build file:
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1110726: Invalid generated build.xml can't be removed
    with 'xins clean'.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.1.0 BETA 1:

* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1099406: ProgrammingError should be RuntimeException.
    Replaced class ProgrammingError with class ProgrammingException and
    changed code accordingly.

* XINS/Java Client Framework:
  - Impact of fix for SF.net bug #1099406: Class ProgrammingError was replaced
    with class ProgrammingException. Changed the code accordingly.
  - Implemented simple constraint validation framework.

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1099473: Pattern for incoming parameters breaks
    compatibility. The change has been reverted. It is scheduled for
    re-introduction in XINS 2.0.0.
  - Impact of fix for SF.net bug #1099406: Class ProgrammingError was replaced
    with class ProgrammingException. Changed the code accordingly.
  - Only the "_function" parameter is supported when using either the standard
    or the XML calling convention. The "function" parameter is treated as a
    normal parameter.
  - The XML is first generated on a StringWriter and its content is sent to
    the Servlet PrintWriter afterwards.
    Typical impact on performance: Small to Medium.

* Build and release process:
  - The Java2HTML pages are now uploaded in a TAR GZ file.

* Generated build file:
  - Improved the create-api and create-function targets.
  - The create-api target invokes the create-function target as APIs must have
    at least one function.

* Build and release process:
  - Added the target "tests-ui" to run the unit tests in a graphical
    environment.
  - Fixed: The XINS protocol documentation was not included in the release.
  - Added the Ant script for NetBeans 4 to the demo directory.

* Libraries:
  - Updated xmlenc from 0.45 to 0.47, which should result in a performance
    improvement.
    Typical impact on performance: Small.

* Documentation:
  - Added chapter about the integration of XINS in NetBeans 4.0.

* Examples:
  - Fixed TestMyFunction example.
  - The build.xml is to compile and run the examples, an appart script file
    nbbuild.xml has been created for using XINS with NetBeans 4.0.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.1.0 ALPHA 8:

* Logdoc:
  - The missing accesslevel variable problem has been fixed. This bug has been
    in XINS since version 1.1.0 alpha 6.


* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Added tests for class PropertyReaderUtils.
  - Added toString class function in PropertyReaderUtils.
  - Added class CollectionUtils with one class function called "list". This
    function converts an Iterator to an ArrayList.
  - Improved tests for class HTTPServiceCaller.
  - Set the unused values to null in the HTTPServiceCaller after poping the
    diagnotisc context identifier.
  - Dispose the variables of the CallExecutor after getting the HTTP result.

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Changed some classes to use the Common log messages for programming
    errors.
  - Moved some common functionality from the CallingConvention subclasses up
    to class CallingConvention self. The calling conventions now behave the
    same with regard to the determination of the function name. If the
    function name is specified both in the parameter "_function" and in the
    parameter "function", then both must be the same. Otherwise the request is
    considered invalid.
    All incoming parameters that do not match the pattern "[a-z][a-z0-9_]*"
    (without the quotes) are considered ignorable and will not be sent down to
    the function.
  - If an access rule file contains itself, the parsing will fail.

* Generated build file:
  - Added the type_1_1.dtd file to the DTD catalog.

* Documentation:
  - Added the documentation about the XINS protocol to the release.
  - Added the new features of XINS 1.1 to the User Guide.

* Tests:
  - Added new tests for the base64 type, the param combos and the input data
    sections.
  - Adapted the framework to facilitate the testing of the XML calling
    convention.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.1.0 ALPHA 7:


* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Added tests for the ExpiryStrategy class. This revealed a bug which caused
    the slot count to be incorrect if the time-out is not a multiple of the
    precision.
  - Changed the ExpiryStrategy to use weak references to the ExpiryFolder
    instances instead of strong references.
  - Marked class Doorman as deprecated. The ExpiryFolder implementation no
    longer uses a Doorman but uses synchronized sections instead. Effictively,
    this fixes the following SF.net bugs:
    . #1089007: Memory leak in Doorman
    . #1089086: Programming error in ExpiryStrategy / Doorman
    . #1089597: Time-outs while calling Doorman.enterAsWriter()
    . #1089600: Time-outs while calling Doorman.enterAsReader()
  - ExpiryFolder now has a constructor that just takes a name and an
    ExpiryStrategy. The old constructor (which accepted a 'strict' flag and a
    maximum queue wait time) has been deprecated.
  - Fixed various Checkstyle-reported issues.
  - Added EMPTY_PROPERTY_READER class field in class PropertyReaderUtils.
  - Changed HTTPCallRequest.getParameters() so it never returns null anymore.
    This helps to avoid NullPointerExceptions.

* XINS/Java Client Framework:
  - Fixed various Checkstyle-reported issues.

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Fixed various Checkstyle-reported issues.
  - Slightly improved the exception handling in class APIServlet.

* Build and release process:
  - Generated Javadoc API docs now link to Servlet 2.4 API docs at
    xins.sourceforge.net. Previously they linked to Servlet 2.3 API docs at
    java.sun.com.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.1.0 ALPHA 6:

* Logdoc:
  - Fixed en_US translation of log 3210, 3216, 3223, 3412, 3419 and 3424 to
    include the reason.
  - Fixed bug #1088500: the logdoc element set in impl.xml has now an
    accesslevel attribute.
  - Added support for exception-property elements in translation definition
    documents. Had to add a new version of the DTD for this.

* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1089602: Message for programming error in Perl5Matcher
    incorrect.
  - The diagnostic context identifier is removed after being poped
    otherwise the thread stays in memory.
  - Reset some variables after the HTTP call, so that the variables can be
    garbage collected.
  - Improved log entries 1050, 1051 and 1052. Including much more information
    for the reporting programming errors and unexpected exceptions.
  - Added Utils class.


* XINS/Java Client Framework:
  - Sending down _convention=_xins-std with each call.

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Applied a lot of small improvements to the APIServlet class in terms of
    documentation, exception handling, logging, etc.
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1091683: Log message 3213 now correctly logs the class
    name of the Manageable object that is bootstrapping.
  - Added support for the XINS XML calling convention (_xins-xml).
  - Changed NoSuchFunctionException so it no longer supports the function name
    to be null, since this is now handled in the CallingConvention.

* Libraries:
  - Updated xmlenc from 0.45 to 0.46.

* Generation of server-side Java code:
  - Fixed the parameter name set in the web.xml file used for the calling
    convention to the correct value.

* Generated test forms:
  - Sending down _convention=_xins-std with each call.

* Generated specification documentation:
  - Sending down _convention=_xins-std with calls to _GetVersion,
    _GetStatistics and _GetSettings.


* Generation of server-side Java code:
  - Fixed bug #1089121: The exclusive-or param-combo did not work properly.

* Build and release process:
  - Supporting 'no-upload' property. See 'ant help'.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.1.0 ALPHA 5:

* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1065083: No fatal errors at init for malformed URLs.
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1079069. The first line of the class description was:
    "Abstractgion of a manageanble object". Fixed those 2 typos.
  - Changed some classes to throw a ProgrammingError instead of an Error, if
    appropriate.
  - Extended tests in ServiceCaller class to make sure the implementation is
    implementing the correct methods.
  - Moved some unit tests for org.xins.common packages from
    org.xins.tests.common.util to org.xins.tests.common.
  - Extended test set for class TargetDescriptor.
  - Changed pattern: removed obsolete escapes; changed 0-9 range into \d;
    changed [a-zA-Z] range into [a-z], using the
    Perl5Compiler.CASE_INSENSITIVE_MASK in the call to the
    Perl5Compiler.compile() method instead to enable case-insensitive matches.


* XINS/Java Client Framework:
  - Changed some classes to throw a ProgrammingError instead of an Error, if
    appropriate.
  - Made some preparations for implementing SF.net RFE #1054504:
    - changed class UnsuccessfulXINSCallException to non-final, although all
      methods remain final;
    - added UnsuccessfulXINSCallException subclasses:
      . AbstractCAPIErrorCodeException;
      . InternalErrorException;
      . InvalidRequestException;
      . InvalidResponseException.
    - added UnsuccessfulXINSCallExceptionFactory class.
    - added BasicUnsuccessfulXINSCallExceptionFactory class, extends
      UnsuccessfulXINSCallExceptionFactory.
    - changed XINSServiceCaller to use an UnsuccessfulXINSCallExceptionFactory
      to create UnsuccessfulXINSCallException instances, added a getter and a
      setter for this;
    [ work in progress, one AbstractCAPIErrorCodeException subclass needs to
      be generated per error code, an UnsuccessfulXINSCallExceptionFactory
      subclass needs to be generated and the CAPI class needs to create the
      factory and set it on the XINSServiceCaller ]

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - If the org.xins.server.config is not set as a system property, the server
    will also try to get the org.xins.server.config from the bootstrap
    properties.
  - Fixed bug #1076638: The generated context ID was not conform to the
    architect group recommendation.

  - The server classes now use the org.xins.common.xml.Element class instead
    of the deprecated org.xins.server.Element class.
  - Added calling convention which allows to specify in which format the data
    should be received and returned. Two implementation are provided,
    "xins-std" and "xins-old".

* Logdoc:
  - The parameter types are now defined in the DTD.
  - Optimized performance: the Logger object is looked up only once, the first
    time that the entry is logged.
    Typical impact on performance: Major.

* Build and release process:
  - Fixed bug #1078313: Compilation and Javadoc is done from the source code.
    Compilation and Javadoc generation will be faster.

* Generated build file:
  - Fixed bug #1078317: Compilation and Javadoc of the API is now done using
    the files of the impl directory without copying them to the build
    directory. This will increase compilation and javadoc generation
    performances.

* Generation of server-side Java code:
  - An object is created for the data input parameter.

* Generation of CAPI classes:
  - Optimized performance: Made SECRET_KEY a class field.
    Typical impact on performance: Mimimal.

* Build and release process:
  - Fixed bug #1078313: Compilation and Javadoc is done from the source code.
    Compilation and Javadoc generation will be faster.
  - Fixed netbeans-debug target.

* Libraries
  - Updated xmlenc from 0.44 to 0.45, which should result in a performance
    improvement.
    Typical impact on performance: Medium.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.1.0 ALPHA 4:

* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Added class CallConfig in package org.xins.common.service. Objects of this
    type specify certain aspects of how a call is executed. For example, for
    an HTTP service caller, a CallConfig object could specify what HTTP method
    (GET, POST, etc.) to use.
  - Added HTTPCallConfig class (derives from CallConfig).
  - Changed ServiceCaller to work with CallConfig objects. Some members have
    been deprecated in favour of newer ones that work with CallConfig objects.
    Greatly improved the documentation in the ServiceCaller class [work in
    progress].

  - Added UnsupportedProtocolException in org.xins.common.service package.
    Documented in ServiceCaller class that this exception should be thrown by
    ServiceCaller subclasses if a TargetDescriptor with an unsupported
    protocol is passed.
  - Changed TargetDescriptor to support capitals in the protocol part of the
    URL. This fixes SF.net bug #1075248.
  - Added ProgrammingError class. An instance of this class should be thrown


    when appropriate, especially after any of the log messages 1050, 1052,
    2050, 2052, 3050 and 3052 [work in progress].

* XINS/Java Client Framework:
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1071731: UnacceptableResultXINSCallException constructor
    threw a NullPointerException instead of the documented
    IllegalArgumentException.
  - The AbstractCAPICallResult class adds the following methods:
    . long duration()                    -- Returns the call duration, in
                                            milliseconds.
    . CallExceptionList exceptions()     -- Returns the list of
                                            CallException instances.
    . TargetDescriptor succeededTarget() -- Returns the target for which the
                                            call succeeded.
  - Refactored the XINSCallRequest and added new setter methods.
  - Added possibility to have a data element as input.
  - Removed the constructor that accepts a XINSServiceCaller from the
    AbstractCAPI class. This constructor was added in XINS 1.1.0-alpha3. Added
    a new constructor that accepts a Descriptor and a XINSCallConfig object
    instead. The other constructor (which accepts a Descriptor only) remains
    deprecated. There should still be no effect, since the constructors are
    considered internal to XINS.
  - Added XINSCallConfig class (derives from CallConfig).
  - Removed the XINSServiceCaller constructor that accepts an HTTPMethod and
    replaced it by one that accepts a XINSCallConfig object. The removed
    constructor was added in XINS 1.1.0-alpha3.

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - The _GetStatistics meta-function now supports statistics per error code.
    To retrieve these details, pass "detailed=true" to this function.
  - If the bootstrap of the API failed, then the APIServlet now throws a
    ServletException that contains a reference to the cause exception, for
    improved exception handling. Also, if an InvalidPropertyValueException is
    thrown during this bootstrap process, the reason is now logged as well.
  - Added the possibility to have a data element as input.

* Generated CAPI classes:
  - All call methods now return a function result object, never void. This
    change is backwards compatible with XINS 1.0.
  - All function result objects now contain the call duration, the exceptions
    (if any) and a link to the succeeded target. See the changes for the
    AbstractCAPICallResult class for details.
  - Implemented SF.net RFE #1071756: The MANIFEST.MF file in generated CAPI
    JAR file now contains the version of XINS used to generate the JAR file.
  - Added the possibility to have a data element as input.
  - The generated CAPI classes now no longer offers a constructor that takes a
    XINSServiceCaller. This constructor was introduced in XINS 1.1.0-alpha3.
    Instead, a factory method is introduced. There are 2 forms:
    . public static final CAPI create(PropertyReader, String, XINSCallConfig)
    . public static final CAPI create(PropertyReader, String)
    These methods construct a CAPI instance based on a set of properties and

    the name of an API. The optional XINSCallConfig object can be used to
    configure the XINS service caller.

* Generation of server-side Java code:
  - The MANIFEST.MF file in generated WAR file now contains the version of
    XINS used to generate the WAR file.
  - Added the possibility to have a data element as input.

* Generated Javadoc now lists the groups of packages in the following order:
  - Logdoc, Common, Client and finally Server. This should now generally be
    applied as the preferred order.

* Generation of specification documentation:
  - The num attribute for the examples is now optional.
  - Added the possibility to have a data element as input.
  - Added the input-data-example element to specify a data section example
    in the input.
  - Renamed data-example element to output-data-example element. The old
    data-example is still supported for compatibility issues.

* DTD:
  - Remove element or attribute checking already done by the DTD.
  - Added type_1_1.dtd that contains the new types float32, float64, and
    base64.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.1.0 ALPHA 3:

* XINS/Java Common Library
  - Added class function quote(Object) to class TextUtils.

* XINS/Java Client Framework:
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1069436: No function name included in the description of
    a XINSCallRequest object and consequently in the message for
    CallExceptions for a XINS call request. Improved the XINSCallRequest
    description string.
  - The AbstractCAPI class now adds a constructor that accepts a
    XINSServiceCaller. The other constructor, which accepts a Descriptor, has
    been deprecated. The effect is minimal, since the constructors are
    considered internal to XINS.
  - A XINSCallRequest does not have to specify an HTTP method anymore. If it
    is not specified, then the XINSServiceCaller determines what HTTP method
    to use. Consequently, an XINSServiceCaller object now has an HTTPMethod
    object associated with it.
  - Added tests for class XINSCallRequest.

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Added the possibility to point to an ACL file in the ACL runtime property.

* Generated CAPI classes:
  - The generated CAPI classes now offer a constructor that takes a
    XINSServiceCaller.

* Other:
  - Removed src/ant/transform.xml which was no longer used since XINS 0.165.
  - Slightly improved and cleaned the 'xins' shell script. Now the '-version'
    and the 'version' argument both work the same. Also, the shell script now
    calls Ant only once. Then Ant first does the transformation from
    xins-project.xml to build.xml and then executes the generated build.xml
    directly.
    Note that the xins.bat batch file has not been changed yet.
  - Linking to Apache Ant 1.6.2 API docs at xins.sourceforge.net, since they
    are not available at apache.org.
  - Improved performance of release process greatly. Biggest gain is made by
    sending a compressed archive of files to the web server instead of all
    individual files separately.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.1.0 ALPHA 2:

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - If no build version is provided, just set a warning in the log instead of
    throwing a exception.

* XINS/Java Client Framework:
  - Improved XINSCallResultParser with regard to logging, documentation,
    memory use and performance.
  - Changed DataElement class to support namespaces. Some methods have been
    deprecated in favor of new ones.

* Generation of server-side Java code:
  - Import type classes for the generated implementation class.

* Generation of specification documentation:
  - Added support for multiple elements in the output data section.

* Logdoc:
  - Added French locale.
  - XML files are now in UTF-8 encoding format.
  - Fixed small error on the English translation of the server side logdoc.
  - Translation bundle are now possible on multiple lines.

* Libraries
  - Upgraded Log4J from 1.2.6 to 1.2.9.
  - Upgraded Jakarta Commons Logging from 1.0.3 to 1.0.4.
  - Upgraded xmlenc from 0.43 to 0.44.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.1.0 ALPHA 1:

NOTE: This release is based on XINS 1.0.0-beta11.

* XINS/Java Client Framework:
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1063699: Log if call fails on error code. The log
    message 2112 was already defined for this purpose, but it was just not
    used in the code.
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1063672 (XINS call logging: Only first failure is
    logged). Each individual failure is now logged, per target.
  - Fixed bug #1063818: XINSResultParser fails if spaces exist between XML
    elements.
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1063785: Double spaces in description of a
    XINSCallRequest.
  - Removed deprecated methods from class DataElement:
    . public Iterator getChildren()
    . public Iterator getChildren(String name)
    Changed the tests accordingly.
  - Removed class field SERVICE_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE that was deprecated since XINS
    1.0.0-beta6.
  - Removed log message which previously had the ID 2101, since it did not add
    any information. Previously it was logged right after a call was
    performed, whether it was successful or not. Replaced it by a log message
    that indicates that a successful XINS result was received. This message
    previously had ID 2111, but it was never actually logged. Now it is, but
    on 2101. The ID 2111 is now used for a new log message for unexpected
    exceptions caught while calling the XINS service.
  - Removed log message with ID 2107 (XINS result received, status code is
    considered acceptable) since it not considered useful.
  - Now actually logging message 2109 (Unrecognized I/O error while calling
    XINS service).
  - Unified translations in the 21xx range.
  - Changed level of the following log messages to WARNING:
    . 2102 (was INFO);
    . 2103 (was INFO);
    . 2104 (was INFO);
    . 2105 (was INFO);
    . 2106 (was INFO);
    . 2108 (was INFO);
    . 2109 (was NOTICE);
    . 2110 (was NOTICE);
    . 2111 (was INFO);

    . 2112 (was INFO).
  - Added log message 2113: XINS call request completely failed.
  - Changed log messages 2200 and 2206 to include namespace.
  - Improved XINSCallResultParser behavior. Logging is improved and the parser
    is now XML Namespaces-aware.

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Fixed bug #1036854: Reset logging subsystem when reloading.
  - If the "org.xins.server.config.reload" is zero the FileWatcher won't be
    started.
  - Added _ReloadProperties meta function.
  - Changed the way the _GetSettings meta-function retrieves the system
    properties. It now succeeds without throwing an exception even if a
    SecurityManager denies access to system properties.
    This fixes an issue with the integration with NetBeans 4.0-beta2.
  - Slightly changed exception handling in bootstrapping code in API class.
    The behavior should remain the same, though.

* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Added new types Float32 and Float64.
  - Added new type Base64.
  - Added a new Base64 class that perform base 64 encoding and decoding.
  - Changed the level of all Logdoc messages in the 'service' group to DEBUG.
    Proper logging is the responsibility of the ServiceCaller subclass and
    corresponding classes.
  - Changed UnexpectedExceptionCallException constructor: The 'cause' argument
    is now mandatory.
  - Changed FileWatcher class: Logging message 1052 each time a callback
    method throws an exception. The exception is still ignored, as before.
  - Changed HTTPServiceCaller class: Logging message 1052 when
    HttpMethod.releaseConnection() throws an exception. The exception is still
    ignored, as before.
  - Changed TimeOutController class: Logging message 1052 when
    Thread.join(int) throws an InterruptedException. The exception is still
    ignored, as before.

* Generated CAPI classes:
  - Fixed bug #1061692: A NullPointerException was thrown when using
    Java 1.4.0 or Java 1.4.1.

* Generation of specification documentation:
  - Fixed bug #1061692: A NullPointerException was thrown when using
    Java 1.4.0 or Java 1.4.1.
  - Fixed bug #1064487: The function name is not written in the examples.

* Generation of server-side Java code:
  - Fixed bug #1061692: A NullPointerException was thrown when using
    Java 1.4.0 or Java 1.4.1.
  - Fixed bug #1063006: log.xml with alpha DTD fails if no server reachable.
  - The xins-client.jar file is now also included in the generated war file.

* Generation of types Java code:
  - Fixed bug #1061692: A NullPointerException was thrown when using
    Java 1.4.0 or Java 1.4.1.
  - Added new types float32 and float64.
  - Added new type base64.
  - If the type is not specified '_text' is used as default.

* Logdoc:
  - Added new types float32 and float64.

* Javadoc
  - Changed URL at the bottom of the pages to http://www.xins.org.

* Build and release process:
  - Adapted the release process to the new XINS version format.
  - Added netbeans-debug task.
  - Disabled optimization for javac.

* Libraries:
  - Updated Apache Jakarta Commons HttpClient from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2.

* Added support for the -version argument for the xins commands.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.0.1 FINAL:

* Tests
  - The unknownFunction and unknownMetaFunction tests used to take 5 seconds.
    This is fixed.

* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Set the unused values to null in the HTTPServiceCaller after popping the
    diagnostic context identifier.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.0.1 RELEASE CANDIDATE 3:

* XINS/Java Common Library:
  - Fixed a bug in the ExpiryStrategy class, which caused the slot count to be
    incorrect if the time-out is not a multiple of the precision.
  - Changed the ExpiryStrategy to use weak references to the ExpiryFolder
    instances instead of strong references.
  - Marked class Doorman as deprecated. The ExpiryFolder implementation no
    longer uses a Doorman but uses synchronized sections instead. Effectively,
    this fixes the following SF.net bugs:
    . #1089007: Memory leak in Doorman

    . #1089086: Programming error in ExpiryStrategy / Doorman
    . #1089597: Time-outs while calling Doorman.enterAsWriter()
    . #1089600: Time-outs while calling Doorman.enterAsReader()
  - ExpiryFolder now has a constructor that just takes a name and an
    ExpiryStrategy. The old constructor (which accepted a 'strict' flag and a
    maximum queue wait time) has been deprecated.

* Build and release process:
  - Added 'netbeans-debug' target in build.xml file

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.0.1 RELEASE CANDIDATE 2:

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - No longer determining function name in API class _again_, but rather
    pasing the FunctionRequest object from the APIServlet to the API. This
    fixes the problem that XINS 1.0.1-rc1 only accepts a call if both
    _function and function are specified.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.0.1 RELEASE CANDIDATE 1:

* XINS/Java Common:
  - The diagnostic context identifier is removed after being popped
    otherwise the thread stays in memory.
  - Reset some variables after the HTTP call, so that the variables can be
    garbage collected. This should reduce the suspected memory leak.

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Added NDC.remove() after popping the diagnostic context identifier for the
    servlet.

* Generated specification documentation:
  - Sending down _convention=_xins-std with calls to _GetVersion,
    _GetStatistics and _GetSettings.

* Generation of server-side Java code:
  - Fixed the parameter name set in the web.xml file used for the calling
    convention to the correct value.


______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.0.1 BETA 2:

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Added support for calling conventions. By default the "_xins-std" calling
    convention (which is compatible with XINS 1.0.0) is used. However it can

    be overridden in the impl.xml file by setting the property
    org.xins.server.calling.convention to "_xins-old". And this one can again
    be overridden by passing "_convention=_xins-std" with a call request.
  - Improved logdoc:

    - changed entry 3210, added the reason for an invalid property value at
      bootstrap;
    - changed entry 3412, added the reason for an invalid property value at
      initialization;
    - added entry 3230, regarding a security exception while retrieving the
      runtime properties file location;
    - changed entry 3300, regarding initializing the logging subsystem, now
      including the config file name.
  - Some minor improvements in the API servlet regarding state handling,
    exception reporting, logging, etc.

* XINS/Java Client Framework:
  - Sending down "_convention=_xins-std" with each call request.

* Generated test forms:
  - Sending down "_convention=_xins-std" with each call request.

* Libraries:
  - Updated xmlenc from 0.43 to 0.46 to improve performance.
    Typical impact on performance: Medium.
  - Updated Apache Jakarta Commons HttpClient from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2.
    Typical impact on performance: Unknown.

* Logdoc:
  - Optimized performance: the Logger object is looked up only once, the first
    time that the entry is logged.
    Typical impact on performance: Major.

* DTD:
  - Added the calling-convention element to api_1_0_alpha.dtd and
    impl_1_0.dtd.

______________________________________________________________________________
CHANGES INTRODUCED IN XINS 1.0.1 BETA 1:

* XINS/Java Server Framework:
  - Fixed SF.net bug #1076638: The generated diagnostic context ID did not
    conform to the Wanadoo NL Architect Group recommendation. It does now.
  - When a function is called, the <result/> element now contains a "success"
    attribute which is set to "false" if there is an error code and to "true"
    if there is none.
    Also, if there is an error code, it is not only put in the "errorcode"
    attribute, but also in the "code" attribute.
    This is to improve compatibility with XINS 0.130 and XINS 0.168, which are
    still used in production systems.
